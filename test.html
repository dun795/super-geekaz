 In this example, we have a simple HTML structure with a grid layout for the portfolio items. The CSS styles define the layout and appearance of the portfolio items, including the image, title, description, and button. The styles also include hover effects for better interactivity and responsive adjustments for smaller screens. 
 You can customize the styles further to match your design requirements and add more portfolio items as needed.
